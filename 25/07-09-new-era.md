Officially one week out until I'll be leaving my front desk job at a gym. I've been here for almost 2 years, working the opening shift (4:30-9am) Monday thru Friday. While only getting paid minimum wage ($8.25/hour for all interested), this job has been life-changing. It has forced me to contend with the ways I **let** myself fall short. 

* Firstly, it started with my not-so-proactive habits. Those have since stopped and it has been 234 days since.  
* Secondly, my relationship with food and consumption as a whole. I'd say I have worked 90% of my shifts fasted.   
* Thirdly, maintaining my hygeniue habits. I'm in a customer facing role and I work at a dirty gym, enough said. 
* Fourthly, my sleep, ultimately the most important thing I've been addressing. I was absolutely not getting proper sleep for half of the time that I've been here. As of late, if I get anything less than 7 hours of quality sleep, I am performing at sub-optimal levels. I feel it in my patience, in my willingness, in my ability to stay mentally present, I succumb more to hunger and anger, etc. It's not something I'm willing to put myself through just to be able to enjoy myself late in the evening. If I'm missing sleep, it's for good reasons, no exceptions otherwise.
* Finally, my relationship to my body, especially my self-esteem. I never consistently worked out or only ever worked out with someone else. I hold a lot of pain in areas that I've never addressed. I never felt comfortable operating at my full range of motion (essentially, taking up space). I have never been entirely present within my body and there were always mental hurdles to get over once I started working out. It took until the VERY end, but I'm finally utilizing the free gym membership I get by working here. I can feel the difference and it truly affects every aspect of myself and has directly influenced how I think about breaking up my days, what I put into my body, and how much sleep I need to recover to do it all again tomorrow, the ever elusive "tomorrow". 

Thank you to this job. I'm sad to leave for all the memories, the uninterrupted hours of pure flow (only sayingh hi to people and ushering them in like sheep), and the people I've met along the way. But I'm ultimately ready to get paid what I'm worth, for my skills, and especially for my interests and curosity. 

And I'm extremely grateful for my parents for letting me stay with them rent-free while I worked part-time. What I didn't pay for monetarily, I paid for with my emotional body, my patience, and my presence. As a family, we have gotten closer, I have become more honest and willing to share, we've started working through clutter that's been condensed around the house and within a storage unit, and looking at the nature of my family's financial health. 

You gotta take care of your parents man, above all else. If your relationship with them is redeemable and they are still alive, take advantage of that. I hear too often what people would have said or done, but they are gone. At the end of the day, life is too short. Stay where your feet are above all else. 

Here's the new era that's been 2 years in the making. I owe it to everyone who has experienced me. Thank you.
