It has become blaringly obvious to me that I've been stuck in the past. In my mindsets especially. 

I have let past heartaches and mistakes blind me. I have let old emotions continue to sway me, take me out in the vast ocean in a boat full of holes, more water coming in than I can get out. 

But I forgot that I know how to swim. There is no longer a shore in sight anymore, but that's okay. I will be okay.

What brought this on is that I made a connecton and then had a realization about how frequently I think about things that have happened to me in the past 5 years.

Then, just when I was getting somewhere, I was fired in 2021 and in 2022, back to back jobs. I already had little faith in myself as a whole and now my abilities as a software engineer. I let this manifest into being as the inability to find and keep a well-paying job. I worked at a restaurant as a dishwasher and cashier afterwards. When my lease was up, I saw no point/no hope in staying in Austin, and moved back home into my parents' house. I've been working at a gym since, the longest job that I've ever held down (going on 2 years in August 2025). 

For the past 5 years, I have let the culmination of these experiences define me and the direction I've been going in. There have been other little things too - loss of love, friends and family, thousands of job rejections, the world opening back up and being same but different, relapsing.

I won't lie, it's been very hard. But I've managed to pull myself out of the hellscape that is my own doing. I am more open to help and to seeing how I have played a hand in literally everything. I'm more open to talking about what's going on, in my life and in my head.

For too long, I have focused too much on the external. Only recently have I begun to shift my focus inward, priortizing my peace of mind and serentity. I use the word "serentity" intentionally. Everyday, I let go of the past. The past is gone, truly. 

Everyday is a new day. A new era of my life is starting, and with it, I have become anew. I thank God / The Universe / some Higher Power / my future self for the clarity and the presence I live everyday with. What is for me won't pass me by, but I have to put in the work to meet it half way. 

Let's get to work.
