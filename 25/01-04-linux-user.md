Happy New Year!

I have a Thinkpad T490 now! I didn't like Windows so I installed Ubuntu to give it a try. It's not that much different from a Mac and I've enjoyed the experience and learning new ways to get around. I even installed a new terminal, [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)! 

I'm 1 1/2 months sober from drugs and 1 month sober from drinking. I severely cut back in 2024, but now it's intention. No more "half a beer" here and "just a hit" there. I have a lot of potential to live up to and to bring forth in my life, it's for the best that I have a clear mind. Right now, I use caffeine, nicotine, and meditation to get through my days. 

As I move and exist on the internet, I realize more and more people just want to share their creations. That's exactly what this blog/journal is about, to an extent. I mainly use them as checkins for myself as a developer - even when I'm not really developing anything. 

It all starts in the mind. My environment as a developer is first between my ears. 

I have big plans for myself and this year. It starts with me. I hope anyone who comes across this has a good year as well (and everyone who won't).
