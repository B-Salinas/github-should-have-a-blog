~~Trying out a .txt file this time!!~~

There is a Super Full Moon (in Aries) that peaks at 11:47 pm cst tonight. It's going to be beautiful. The Harvest Full Moon is always my favorite, the first full moon of Fall. 

Yesterday, I did something that I've never done: I was honest about my feelings, vulnerable, and owned up to my own truth. The Universe responsed to my courage in kind by this person responding within a minute of my sharing. I've never experienced anything like that: both the reaction and also taking the opportunity to own who I am and who I have become. It was amazing, I'm still riding the high of it! 

Not only that, but on Saturday, October 04 would have been my 7th year sobriety date, had I stayed sober from October 04, 2018. I absolutely did not have the foundational within my self to make it that long, but what's important is that I do now. I will hit my 1 year sober mark on November 16 this year, but until then, one day at a time. 

I'm being transformed and I'm in the middle of it. It's being reflected in all of my relationships: almost all of my friends have the pedal to the metal right now, the axe to the grindstone, lugging away and putting things down in their books. I feel like I'm the last one but at the same time, I'm aware. 

You can feel the shift on the horizon - that's the harvest moon's energy.
