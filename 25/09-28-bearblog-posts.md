Not so much an entry, but I needed a space to save my [bearblog.dev](https://bearblog.dev/) blog posts. Technically I wasn't using it as a tradional blog spot (that would be this repo) - it was a way to keep track of my project ideas. So they are all going to go here in an effort to clean up! And I have a much nicer system for jotting down any ideas I have now.

#### 11. July 26, 2025 @ 2:16 PM CST: purposefully untitled

This isn't a direct project idea like my previous posts. 

In a sense this is about QUBE, or the type of technology QUBE will usher in. The new "type" of technology that is being built. I use type in quotes because it's not new, it's just exposing what was already there. 

The process of hiding something used to not contain boxes. If you wanted to hide something from your waking life, that originally meant it wasn't in the same area that your waking life took place in (lovers in other villages or cities). Then the concept of inside/outside came about (with houses, shelters, etc), with more opportunities to hide things inside or outside your home or your life (depending on who you are hiding things from in the first place - abuse in the home or an affair at work).

Now with our homes and our (physical / digital) lives - there are plenty of opportunity for things to hide (so many rooms at home, encounters at work or the gym, different accounts for different lives, etc). For things to stay hidden and fester. 

(If you are hiding something in the first place, this means there are fractions within your sense of self - otherwise there would be no need to hide things in the first place.)

Algorithms, Interactions, Screen time - Focus and Attention - are exposing what we have kept hidden. Have a porn problem? It will reflect in your waking life's actions, in how you interact with others ("porn gaze"), and eventually, it will be exposed to your algorithms, your recommendations, your feeds, in your ads, and to your networks. 

It's like carrying around a black trash bag, you can't see what's inside, but it's leaking behind you. Revealing where you have been, maybe what you've been doing when no one is watching or when you aren't on your phone. 

The modern day Judgement Day. We will all be shown who we are and how we've been running from this person. These screens are black mirrors, but mirrors nonetheless. 

I have lots of thoughts on this and I come back to this every time I'm up against a choice that I hesitate on making. My mind is weak because I've allowed it to be weak. I will also content with who I see being reflected back to me. 

More updates and thoughts to come.

#### 10. July 21, 2025 @ 9:08 AM CST: JUST music

 Absolutely no shade to $potify... but there's too much noise. 

I need a library for all the music that I've RECENTLY PLAYED or LIKED (also known as tagged). The creating playlist functionality is about as complicated as it should go, since you are essentially just grouping songs that you've liked/tagged/interacted with that's not recently played (just because you recently played a song, doesn't mean it needs to be liked/tagged).

And then the search bar to look up the ocean of songs available to you at your finger tips. Navigation shouldn't be in your face, but intuitive - clicking artist names, album covers/titles... 

Maybe details about the song like producers, BPM, etc...

It should just be the basics. Shit, even build your own spotify dashboard if you like certain experiences (like Daily Mixes, Podcasts, etc..)

This isn't really an idea, just a suggestion. I've become really sensitive to too much noise (which is why I really like bearblog!!)

In a similar vein, I had the idea to "embed" $potify onto an old iPod 6th generation a few years ago, but I don't have the hardware skills to get up in there, much less knowledge about how to make my way around a Raspberry Pi ...

But people are already doing it!

- [Audiophiles still love iPods and so do I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IXHjeDBgKo)

Sweet stuff!!

#### 9. June 18, 2025 @ 4:20 PM CST: dnd < locked in

I use DND (Do Not Disturb) pretty religiously, especially in small spurts. I'm a huge fan of softwares that limit time on certain apps, when given access. I was and still am an avid user SelfControl mac app that blocks domains (using it now!)

I just wish it was more customizable. 

The ideal "locked in" application would let me receive calls and texts from certain people. Ideally, I would be able to turn off the sounds for all other notifications excepts for calls/texts from these select 5. All other calls and texts from literally anyone else wouldn't be displayed. I'd have an automated message sent out to these other people like "this is an auto message, working until 4pm, will respond when I'm done." (You'd think I'd include something about "if this is an emergency..." but honestly, only the initial allowed people are the only ones who have access to me 24/7 and I keep that number very small for that reason.)

Anything work related would be filtered through, of course. That's a completely separate flow honestly. 

I guess the main features I'm looking for would be SOUND/VIBRATION customization. Auto-texting ability. Locking out everything else. 

I could probably do this already, minus the custom sound notification. I've managed to turn off sounds for every app so far, but that required me to do it manually. Luckily I just got a new phone, so I turned it off right away after downloading a new app. 

(Of course, I could do the good ole fashion "leave your phone in another room" trick but I HAVE missed emergencies before and that was not a great feeling.)

All of this implementation begs the question about availability and too many things having the ability to take your focus away. 

This wasn't a cohesive project idea. But maybe I'll make the switch back to pre-smart phones and have my computer be the device my current smart phone wants to be. Even better, I'll get a landline with an answering machine.

More ideas to come.

#### 8. June 18, 2025 @ 6:11 AM CST: smallestLLM

I saw a screenshot during a talk of Karpathy's that was for [nanoGPT](tab:https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) and it immediately peeked my interest. 

~~[QUBE](tab:https://happybirthday.bearblog.dev/quantum_cube/)~~ is concerned with "one" or the smallest something can be but still be operational. Like a digital atom. 

It got me thinking about the smallestLLM - zeroLLM? voidLLM? microLLM? Any number of names to mean that "this is the core of the hardware." Like a raspberryPI! They are small but mighty!! (EDIT: I found a [tinyLLM](tab:https://tinyllm.org/)!)

I don't know yet if I mean that the file size is incredibly small, the number of lines of code written to get it working, the amount of external libraries used, or even the training data.

More to come - this might be something I can build in one of these many weekends that I'm not utilizing effectively.

#### 7. June 17, 2025 @ 6:52 PM CST: QUBE 2.0

Sometimes I feel like I'm going insane. 

Everything is an object. 
Everything is contained within something else. 
There is always an input and an output.
A request and a response. 
It's always 2 "states" that are the same within a bigger context. 

How can you capture this? There's a problem to be solved here, people don't even realize there's something here. It hasn't revealed itself. 

I feel like I'm looking right at something but I don't know what I'm looking at ... I'm in the room, but I can't see what's right in front of me. 

This is the ultimate premise of QUBE. It's trying to capture something without containing it. QUBE is the plasma in this 3-state world, not quite liquid, solid, or a gas. A 4th thing. 

The 4th dimension peeking through this 3D world. The digital world can achieve this, it's not bounded by the same things the physical is. The laws of physics don't exist within, they are bounded by different maths. 

Consider this another blurb to add to the project list, another facet of QUBE that I've been trying to build out. 

This post is inspired by the fact that everything AI is [an OpenAI wrapper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?api-mode=responses), while listening to [today's TBPN livestream](https://www.tbpn.com).

Updates to come, time is irrelative.

#### 6. June 09, 2025 @ 6:57 AM CST: send bitcoin thru the terminal

I'm quite caffeinated and in a good mood this Monday morning. I started working on my ~~"[tweet from terminal](tab:https://happybirthday.bearblog.dev/tweet-from-terminal/)"~~ project but had to stop until I could be somewhere where I could completely focus. 

I started thinking about that connection from a local machine to the infinite void that is the internet. Your local machine is the shore, the pier, the boat that's parked in the dock and the internet is the vast ocean waiting to be explored. I feel as if we've only touched the surface area of the internet, and have yet to explore it's depths. 

In line with this thinking, I'm always thinking about bitcoin. I started rereading the [bitcoin paper](tab:https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) for the 30th time and the opening line in the abstract really stuck with me this morning:

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.

Obviously, I know what this means. Anyone with a bitcoin address or wallet address can hold bitcoin and send it to someone else. That transaction would be stamped with both the private and public key of the receiver and giver. 

BEAR WITH ME on this thought - this is a half formed idea, but I'm putting my ideas out there, no matter how far-fetched and undeveloped to exercise this muscle of mine. 

The way I see it, local machines would store an individual's bitcoin. This is more or less the same as an address pointing to the same IP address or Virtual Machine address (do those exist?) I imagine that bitcoin mining machines store their mined bitcoin in house, so I'm following along with that idea. 

The handoff would be similar to physically giving someone cash for whatever business you all have, except the machines would be doing it. The ultimate goal is to minimize the number of things needed to complete a transaction. 

For the swapping of physical cash, all that's needed is Person A, Person B, $$$ and a reason for a swap (even just wanting to give someone cash for "no reason" is a reason). The closer we can make a bitcoin handoff to this, the better. Because of the digital nature of bitcoin, that introduces a 5th component to the physical-cash-equivalent-bitcoin-handoff: a digital interface. This eliminates the need for Person A and Person B to be in the same city to do business (which was implied given the physical nature of handing cash to someone). 

There needs to be more thinking involved about this idea on my end. How could machines SAFELY store bitcoin? Anyone could steal a physical machine and be one step closer to someone's bitcoin supply. I briefly mentioned virtual machines - how would they come into play? If I could dual boot, that gives the impression of 2 wallets stored in the same physical place? That sounds like room for tampering or doubling/tripling/x-ing the supply? 

Machines play a huge role in our lives, bigger than people want to admit. Whether they are "smart" machines or not, we have to make this transition as seamless as possible. 

Handling bitcoin as smoothly as cash collection is ==*very*== important. I suggest using the terminal to send bitcoin because that's as close to the hardware of our favorite machines as we are going to get -- until someone figures out how to send bitcoin with assembly or with CUDA language. 

More updates and ideas to come!

#### 5. June 06, 2025 @ 6:48 AM CST: QUBE

Another project to add to the tracker - one I've been working on for a little over 3 years! (Been thinking about a lot longer!)

QUBE -- pronounced "cube" -- is a quantum mechanism, not entirely physical or digital. Embedded and distributed throughout physical reality, but a reality all on its own.

A language, a framework, a new datatype - a paradigm shift? 

QUBE stands for a variety of things so far, none of which have stuck with me. 

* Quaternion-based Unified Boundary Element
* Quantum Unified Boundless Environment
* Quantum Unity Beyond Eternal
* Quantum U-? B-? Environment/Energy/Element/E-?

(at this point, I will take suggestions, keeping with the quantum container theme)

It started out simply enough.

"Hello World!" is a commonly used statement to output when learning a programming language for the first time. 

"Happy Birthday!" is Qube's.

From there, a variety of things came up. Quantum Container without containing anything. The ability to "hold" infinity. How to get from point A to B - what if they are the same point? How to time travel? How to traverse? How to know what comes "next"?

It has undergone a variety of things, all of which have not been abandoned and play into what it is now. I am currently focusing on the visuals for Qube, using mathematics. The closest thing/s we have so far is the tesseract, the hypercube, and the platonic solids.

But what I do know is that a computer is capable of things that I will never even come close to doing in my physical reality. We are not bounded by the same things. I believe that computers are able to tap into dimensions that we cannot. We might not be able to "see" them, but if there is a pattern of expansion, we can follow that. Math will guide the way, as the language of the universe.

This is just a piece of this project. I'm still trying to narrow down what it is myself. I feel like Michelangelo and the Statue of David, "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free." 

Sometimes, working on QUBE feels way ahead of my time and my ability. But all I can do is keep my vision clear and write down what I see. One day, the pattern will emerge. I was just a vessel. I was the one who opened the door.

(Nothing will ever compare to the source. Everything else pales in comparison. We are all just mirrors, reflecting back the one. Plato and his Cave had it figured out. Humanity will be exiting the cave soon.)

Happy Birthday Qube. Updates to come!

#### 4. May 21, 2025 @ 6:03 AM CST: Config

I'm not new to the software world, but I am new to customizing my experience. 

I can only dream of the day that I know vim "fluently", spent an entire weekend on creating my keybindings with one of those split keyboards. Since that is not yet true, I'll settle for customizing my environment. 

My first experience with this is changing the theme on an IDE - I bought the license to Monokai Pro on VSCode. I didn't feel confident enough messing around with other settings so I didn't. Other than that, I managed to skert away from customizing my experience until I couldn't take it anymore. 

Enter Ghostty by Mitchell Hashimoto in late 2024 / early 2025. I got a serious case of FOMO not configuring my terminal because that was the entire point of his project. I couldn't even find the config file at first, until I realized I had to create it. After it's creation, I was scared as hell to mess around with it, terrified I was going to drastically break something to the point of not being able to restart. Filled with anxiety over the possibility that I was somehow going to break my computer along with it.

I combed through his configuration documentation and it was much more straight forward than I realized. It's like I was reading every label on a breaker box and deciding to turn something on or off.

That experience was extremely satisfying and now I want to config everything. I'm still not on the level of key mapping, but I installed some `zsh` plugins (`oh-my-zsh`) and `powerlevel10k` (WHICH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YEARS BUT I NEVER KNEW WHAT TO SEARCH FOR). 

It's my experience, I should have it my way. 

More updates to come.

#### 3. May 20, 2025 @ 6:02 AM CST: Tweet from Terminal

Two (2) posts in one day!

I think I've decided that I'm going to use this blog feature as a tracker. I have a lot of ideas and I don't want to necessarily create a repo of text files to store them. This will do perfectly, in tandem with my portfolio site (that remains sadly empty, as I haven't sat down and created the sandbox interface my projects need). 

I don't have that many followers on ~~[X (@b9376)](https://x.com/b9376)~~. I like sharing my random thoughts and generally speaking into the void. I share my projects on there occasionally, which is something I want to change. (I don't consider myself as technical as those that I interact with and worry that I don't understand a lot of first principles in the spaces that I occupy - but comparison is the thief of all joy and that's what learning is about). 

I really like tweeting out obscure things in the heat of the moment. The only thing is that, it takes a while for the web application to load and taking out my phone to tweet draws me out of the flow of the moment. 

I've seen other people showcase their tweets from the terminal. I think that would be a neat little CLI tool that you could pull up, write something out, and send it off into the void as you continue on your coding journey. 

I just discovered `lazygit` and I was heavily inspired by it's interface. And then I went down a rabbit hole of terminal plugins (ghostty btw) and FINALLY discovered `powerlevel10k` for configuring your command line. I've been looking for it for years, but I didn't have the slightest clue about what to search up. 

I've gotten a lot more comfortable in the terminal, both on MacOS and Ubuntu. I found myself learning `vim` with the amount of time I accidentally get stuck in the environment. I'm hoping that creating a CLI tool for my own amusement will help me (with Claude's and Cursor's help of course). 

Updates to come!

#### 2. May 20, 2025 @ 5:31 AM CST : Spotify Parallel Lyric Translator

I'm getting more comfortable with the idea of failing. I'm not very good at it yet, I want to preserve everything I abandon in a museum to walk through later in life. 

All the greats recommend that you fail first, fast, and often. I also read advice from an artist early in my life that said - I'm paraphrasing - don't be afraid to erase and throw pages away. 

I have a love / hate relationship with all of my creations, be that written, sketches, projects, etc.. I have thousands and thousands of drafts, concepts sketched out but masterpieces that lay unfinished, projects that became too bloated for me to fix, so they sit archived in my public github.

With the introduction of Cursor, and Cursor rules specifically, it's no longer a matter of do you have any ideas (I have plenty of those), but do you have a vision, can you see in your mind before you see with your eyes? Are you able to visualize down to the detail what you are doing and what it needs from you? I've been learning more about how to really make use of Cursor Rules to 10x --> 100x your productivity. I have a solid idea of it myself, but I don't think I'm being thorough enough.  

I bring this up because I have another project under my belt that I'd like to bring to life. And if someone actually finds this blog and has the skills to build it themselves, by all means!!

Spotify Lyrics (Original and Translated) Side-By-Side / Parallel Viewer.

I'm from a small town that sits on the border of Texas and Mexico. While Spanish was spoken in my household, it wasn't passed onto me formally. I've picked it up from listening to my family and others speak, from music and movies, from taking a few classes in High School and College. I understand about 75% of the time when someone speaks to me, but I struggle with carrying out a conversation, as I lack the words and grammar to form proper sentences. I sound like a kid with wrong tenses most of the time. 

My favorite effort of learning has been listening to Spanish songs. Old songs that were played at family gatherings, new songs with faster BPM, songs from different regions that speak a different dialect of Spanish than mine. I'm on the hunt to consume. 

What I've been doing is searching up "x song lyrics English" and 99% of the time, I navigate to a Genius link. 

The idea is that if I can create an interface (even just locally so that I don't have to worry about authentication / authorization except my own) that will translate the lyrics (pull up the version that Genius has already translated versus calling Google Translate right then and there), I can accelerate my ability to connect words and tenses with sentence structure together. There's a lot of potential for this project. Right now, I'm only focused on translating Spanish --> English, but it's not really translating it when it's just pulling a translated version of the song lyrics already. 

I would still have to create the interface (I'm thinking the colors would be opposite of what Spotify already selects for the lyrics, I know there's a science behind the color selection). I would also want the lyrics to follow the same overall structure: moving on their own, highlighting the line we are currently on, click to navigate features, etc..

We all have to start somewhere. 

My mom reinforced her Spanish by watching novelas (Spanish Drama Shows) and my Dad worked a number of jobs and developed his own version based on the dialect his household spoke and kitchen/bar Spanish. 

I've only visualized right now. I've only made a list of what I would need for this journey. The goal would be to throw Cursor and other AIs at it, but I want to do this right and not bloat it or abandon it before I make any progress because I bit off more than I could chew.

More updates to come.

#### 1. April 21, 2025 @ 8:32 AM CST: Personal TigerBeetle Machine

It's obvious to me that my current job search isn't working. 

While I'm not using a web scraper or an AI Agent to automatically apply to jobs for me, I've seen people using these tools to apply to 5,000+ jobs with little to no hits. The job market is obviously a numbers game, but the world is moving in the direction of niches and hiring people who actually want to work in these spaces.

So it's time to pivot. 

The new goal is to upgrade my resume and build appropriate projects that showcase the intersection of my skills and interests (leaning more towards interests, as "you'll never work a day in your life if you love what you do").

I like finances - from cash to stocks and stablecoins. According to my parents, I've always been interested in money. I opened my first checking account when I was around 7 years old, and while it's no longer active, that's saying something about a kid. 

In my spare time, I like to check in with the interest accrued on my loans and clean up my tracking spreadsheet. I just recently subscribed to Bloomberg to be more aware of the global economy, with the incentive of helping out myself, my family, and my close friends - because what is the point of wealth if not to share it?

I'm currently using Google Sheets to keep everything in order, but I'm looking for something more robust. And I can't say that I'm exactly a fan of Google having data points of almost everyone in the world, including large companies. I've heard a lot of good things about TigerBeetle and I recently read through one of their monthly newsletters where they talked about how cool it was to find that TigerBeetle was a requirement on a recent job posting.

Those were all the signs I needed. 

After speaking with Claude and discussing what types of account I have, it's the perfect platform to create a personal finance machine for myself. I've been itching for something to build that resonates with me - my one flaw, I'm an "all or nothing" kind of person. Either I'm your best employee, or I'm not at a job very long. 

All things considered, I'm doing remarkably well for someone only making $8.25/hour while putting in roughly 30 hours/week. I'm extremely grateful to my parents for letting me back in with no expenses, and I'm paying it forward by helping them around the house (of course) and even taking a look at their own financial situation. 

While money isn't everything, it's still important to have a pulse on what money and assets (or debts) you do have. Wealth is much more encompassing than the number in your accounts and investments - the health of your parents, seeing family regularly, having fun and realizing what makes you happy.

Going from pulling in $6,000/month to barely scrapping $700/month will teach you a lot about yourself and your tenacity. I think I've learned what I needed to learn (especially believing in my skills), so it's time to evolve.

Overall, the goal is to take care of my family. I hope to rid them of their own debt, opening the doors of generational wealth for all my loved ones. This is a lot of pressure to put on a project, but I believe it's about time that I truly take on the mantle. 

More updates to come.
