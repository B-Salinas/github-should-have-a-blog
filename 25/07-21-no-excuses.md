I'm officially all settled in. 

Being in this nice apartment, in a new city, living with my brother - it still feels unreal. I almost can't believe how nice things are and how this beautiful space is my own and what I get to come home to everyday. I also cannot believe that I woke up around 3-4am everyday for 2 years (Monday through Friday really but my god). I'll wake up around the same time because my body is used to it and just be in shock. I'll more or less keep the waking up early routine, but it won't be /that/ early.

No luck on the job front yet. I'm really not trying to force absolutely anything in life. I'm meditiating more (or trying to). I've cut out nicotine from my system and only sticking to coffee in the morning, tea in the afternoons, eating good food and sleeping well. Back to the basics because they are the basics for a reason. 

I have cut out social media from my life, with the exception of YouTube (but that doesn't feel like social media...). It was a long time coming, I've had the thought to disappear for years but I never took the leap. I did it slowly and that made all the difference: the instagram app was deleted last summer and officially deactived last fall, my facebook account (which I had for almost 20 years, holy shit) was deactived and deleted last fall, then I went ahead and deleted both my tiktok and twitter's accounts at the beignning of this summer. Just YouTube now. 

I've been focused on myself really. I feel more reflective and connected to my surroundings, what I bring with me especially as it's a manifestation of myself. I take more naps and don't feel guilty about taking them, since I'm more present in my waking life, overall less time within my phone (I averaged about 8 hours a day on my phone, I'm averaging 1-3 right now depending on the day). 

Moving into this next stage of my life, this is what's important to me:
- sleeping well
- eating well
- keeping a clean space
- feeling my body
- taking mental breaks instead of powering through
- taking time for myself, unplugged (even more than I already am)
- connecting with my family
- paying attention to my financial health
- staying sober

The last one is pretty hard right now, honestly, but I understand that's because I've had a lot of big changes lately. At the end of the day, using substances is about self-soothing your own nervous system. A lot of things feel out of control right now, but I can only see this because I have a clear vessel. Remembering why I'm doing this and what exactly I'm doing helps. I just have to stay present, nothing happens anywhere else. 

Not that this is a substitute from updates anyone would get from me directly, but I do wonder if anyone in my real life will ever find these, if they haven't already. I don't talk about my (second) sobriety journey all too much besides giving people my new number - 8 months and 4 days, wow I didn't even realize.

 Going back to the title of this entry, as I got on a tangent, there really are no excuses. Either you do something or you don't. You are responsible for your life and the overall direction that you are traveling in. Only do what lights you up, put your best foot forward, and rest when you are tired.
