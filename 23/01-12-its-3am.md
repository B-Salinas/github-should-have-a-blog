2:56 AM. 

My sleep schedule has been really bad for the last few months. I don't think I've been pushing myself -- I haven't pursued things that excite (scare) me. I lay awake at night, sometimes until 4am, full of restless energy because I didn't do something I wanted to do. 

And a lot of the things that I want to do really scare me, but in a good way. To be a beginner again is a great thing, everything is so fresh. But if you aren't the nicest to yourself, it can be a spot in which you compare more ... knowledgable parts of yourself with areas that still need to grow. 

I'm not the best at math but it's interesting. I hope to be able to understand and code rotational matrices and different shapes, as well as understand how it works soon.
