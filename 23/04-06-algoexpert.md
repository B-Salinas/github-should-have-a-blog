Listening to [What is the AlgoExpert introduction video](https://www.algoexpert.io/product). It's 5:15pm, I was let go from Meta on Tuesday evening.

I'm still in shock, but it's already happened. I've been in this position before when I was let go from a real estate startup. Both were amazing opportunities and I've learned a lot since then.

So I've been here and I know what to do. And I know personally that I need to pursue things that excite me.

I'm scared but also excited to take this next step forward.
