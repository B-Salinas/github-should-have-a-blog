Hm. Lots of change has happened recently in my life, more so mental changes.

After I was let go from Meta, I realized I had been in the exact same spot before. I knew/know what to do and got myself a labour-intensive job to bring in some $$$ while allowing myself to mentally turn off while working. That clear divide to remind myself that I _can_ do something about my situation.

I have lots of plans, hopes, and aspirations for myself. Let's do it.
