Currently watching [Night Driving Seoul City](https://youtu.be/40xZVEFVBuE) - I'm 26yo and I'm not comfortable with the idea of driving, so watching driving POV videos helps me get used to the idea eventually. It's less scary if I've seen it before. 

It's been about a month since I updated this blog, but I feel changed blog. It wasn't perfect, but I participated in the 2023 Chainlink Hackathon by submitting my b-nodes project. I submitted scrapes of what I had (as this is still a WIP) 2 minutes before the deadline closed, onlY FOR THE DEADLINE TO EXTEND BY 2 DAYS.

They extended it in the final hour because I opened up my submission about 5 hours before hand. I can't even be mad that they did that, but I'm glad that I put something out there, even if it's not my best work. "Done is better than perfect" is something I've been repeating myself for years, but I understood it today.
