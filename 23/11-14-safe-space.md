I never ended up coming back to the previous entry. I'm in my room now (hence, safe space) instead of Gold's Gym. My dad and I are driving up to Austin, TX in about 3 hours to retrieve something important. 

Been reflecting a lot, github blog. This whole past year has been one big reflection. Coming to realizations, refining my thinking process. Really coming into my personhood, who I've been showing up as and who I want to show up as in the future. How can I reconcile any gaps within myself, between the here and now. 

And it's been a very weird but revealing experience/journey so far. I'm more or less in the exact same position as I was last year -- at a minimum wage job, working on projects, looking for my next opportunity. But mentally, I'm different. 

But am I really, if things in the physical haven't changed yet? That's about the only part of all this that I get hung up on. I'm thinking different, I'm looking at things differently, I'm excited about different things -- but things in the physical are still the same. I'm still at a minimum wage job, I still haven't made any "outward" progress on my open-source project, I still don't have a license or a car, etc..

I will say, I'm not as discouraged by everything that I'm looking at or experiencing as I would be last year. Last year, not seeing any outward change would have thrown me for a loop. Living in my day to day now, my only thought is "oh, it's not here yet."

Soon. Until next time blog!

WAIT THIS BLOG IS A YEAR OLD NOW!!! 

I don't have a lot of entries, but I'm proud of myself for coming back to this time and time again, just to dump. Comparing my first entry to this one, my thought process and the way I write. Just wow. Real proud of you B, I'm excited to see what's coming.
