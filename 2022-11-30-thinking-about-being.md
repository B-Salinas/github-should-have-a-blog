1:35 PM. Listening to "when you geel like quitting but you know you must carry on and push through" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtFA9rLIuTs&t=2953s).

Also waiting to catch up with an old bootcamp friend, one of my favorite people. Everytime we talk, I feel a shift. 

Been thinking a lot about fear, about mindset, about what I consume for fun, for purpose, just because. Been thinking a lot about what would I like to do for the rest of my life? Not as a career, but during my free time. What'll get me going and keep me from leaving.

Here's to being.
