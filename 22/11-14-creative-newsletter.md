12:07 AM. Listening to MIT OpenCourseWare's Lecture 1: Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo).

I'm surprised Github doesn't have a place for developers to leave their notes, either about their progress as a developer or to-do lists related to prjoects. Maybe I just haven't found it yet, but this is also nice.

I wanted to share that I'm scared to contribute to open source. (Github also scared me for the longest time, to shift through files and files of code. I was and still am scared of getting lost.)

Coding and creating digitally is really cool. I'm not the best at it, and my mistakes feel so weighted, but this is something I want to do. I just wanted to share this thought somewhere.
