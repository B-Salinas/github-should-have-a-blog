8:55PM. Listening to [Alef's "Sol"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30dTTJPRf94&t=2129s) (I found it while scrolling my YouTube feed for a while and I needed something to latch onto while I worked.)

It's been a minute. Time moves very differently for me, so even though it feels like it's been a month or two since I wrote one of these, it's only been 10 days. 

Since then, it's been more than a week since my job at H-Mart -- what an opportunity that was. Being a dishwasher taught me about automation and taking care of important tasks that will pay off later. Being prepared, going with the flow, and dealing with stress as it arises. We only lose our cool if we allow things to get to us. Amazing time, but hard work nonetheless.

I allowed myself to rest for a week, very conscious of burning out and also putting myself at financial risk. I applied to some safe jobs in the area and continued my hunt for software engineering jobs. All the while, following my interests down rabbit holes whenever I had the free time and energy. Something is coming of that, but I have yet to bring it into reality.

And while I still have the onboarding email waiting in my inbox ~~-- it almost seems too good to be true, but I'm working on that --~~ I was offered a contract role as a QA Analyst for Meta! :D

Very exciting and scary things happening. Until next time!
