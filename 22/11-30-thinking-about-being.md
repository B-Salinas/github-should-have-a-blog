#### (2) – Wednesday, Nov 30, 2022 

1:35 PM. 

Listening to "when you feel like quitting but you know you must carry on and push through" [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtFA9rLIuTs&t=2953s).

Also waiting to catch up with an old bootcamp friend, one of my favorite people. Everytime we talk, I feel a shift. 

Been thinking a lot about fear, mindset, what I consume for fun, purpose, and just because. 
Been thinking a lot about what would I like to do for the rest of my life - not as a career but during my free time. 
What'll get me going and keep me from straying?

11:40 PM now. 

Figured I would update the doc since it's still the same day. I'm also finishing up the playlist I was listening to earlier. 

Something did shift today. It was great talking to my buddy - he looks out for me and keeps it real. He has no doubt in what I'm capable of doing, just worried about what I'm walking into. 

Me too. But I have to take a chance on myself.

Side note - I really like Github and the direction it's going in. I'm excited to see what else they come up with.
