12:19 AM. Listening to [Your Higher Self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KObIrOxc1E&t=372s).

I'm exhausted. Mentally, physically, emotionally, all of it. I'm taking a chance on my myself and I'm terrified. Not because I don't have what it takes to step up to the plate, but because of what I'm walking into.

But this is a moment. One of many that is just another choice in my life, yet defines my overall character. I believe in myself. 

My mind is a powerful tool. What I say I can or cannot do, determines what I accomplish. In spite of fear, I'm still here.
