3:11 PM. It's cold out in Austin, TX -- 30°. Listening to "Fading Away" by Elaine on Spotify. 

Just cleaning up shop right now, both digitally, physically, mentally, emotionally, and spirtually. It's important to keep yourself clean and open and I believe that applies to all areas of your life. (But it's also important to live your life, not just clear it out.)

I've also realized lately that every problem in my life currently is a me vs. me thing. I find that I increasingly get in my own way or block my own progress by either not doing the one task / series of tasks that will move me along. I heard recently that doubt is the precursor to fear and I tend to doubt myself. 

There used to be a time where I was fearless, not afraid to jump. My only goal for 2023 is to stretch out and take up that space again, take the leap.
