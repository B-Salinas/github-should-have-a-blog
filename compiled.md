# 2022

#### (5) – Thursday, Dec 22, 2022

3:11 PM. It's cold out in Austin, TX -- 30°. Listening to "Fading Away" by Elaine on Spotify. 

Just cleaning up shop right now, both digitally, physically, mentally, emotionally, and spirtually. It's important to keep yourself clean and open and I believe that applies to all areas of your life. (But it's also important to live your life, not just clear it out.)

I've also realized lately that every problem in my life currently is a me vs. me thing. I find that I increasingly get in my own way or block my own progress by either not doing the one task / series of tasks that will move me along. I heard recently that doubt is the precursor to fear and I tend to doubt myself. 

There used to be a time where I was fearless, not afraid to jump. My only goal for 2023 is to stretch out and take up that space again, take the leap.

8:55PM. Listening to [Alef's "Sol"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30dTTJPRf94&t=2129s) (I found it while scrolling my YouTube feed for a while and I needed something to latch onto while I worked.)

It's been a minute. Time moves very differently for me, so even though it feels like it's been a month or two since I wrote one of these, it's only been 10 days. 

Since then, it's been more than a week since my job at H-Mart -- what an opportunity that was. Being a dishwasher taught me about automation and taking care of important tasks that will pay off later. Being prepared, going with the flow, and dealing with stress as it arises. We only lose our cool if we allow things to get to us. Amazing time, but hard work nonetheless.

I allowed myself to rest for a week, very conscious of burning out and also putting myself at financial risk. I applied to some safe jobs in the area and continued my hunt for software engineering jobs. All the while, following my interests down rabbit holes whenever I had the free time and energy. Something is coming of that, but I have yet to bring it into reality.

And while I still have the onboarding email waiting in my inbox ~~-- it almost seems too good to be true, but I'm working on that --~~ I was offered a contract role as a QA Analyst for Meta! :D

Very exciting and scary things happening. Until next time!

12:19 AM. Listening to [Your Higher Self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KObIrOxc1E&t=372s).

I'm exhausted. Mentally, physically, emotionally, all of it. I'm taking a chance on my myself and I'm terrified. Not because I don't have what it takes to step up to the plate, but because of what I'm walking into.

But this is a moment. One of many that is just another choice in my life, yet defines my overall character. I believe in myself. 

My mind is a powerful tool. What I say I can or cannot do, determines what I accomplish. In spite of fear, I'm still here.

1:35 PM. 

Listening to "when you feel like quitting but you know you must carry on and push through" [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtFA9rLIuTs&t=2953s).

Also waiting to catch up with an old bootcamp friend, one of my favorite people. Everytime we talk, I feel a shift. 

Been thinking a lot about fear, mindset, what I consume for fun, purpose, and just because. 
Been thinking a lot about what would I like to do for the rest of my life - not as a career but during my free time. 
What'll get me going and keep me from straying?

11:40 PM now. 

Figured I would update the doc since it's still the same day. I'm also finishing up the playlist I was listening to earlier. 

Something did shift today. It was great talking to my buddy - he looks out for me and keeps it real. He has no doubt in what I'm capable of doing, just worried about what I'm walking into. 

Me too. But I have to take a chance on myself.

Side note - I really like Github and the direction it's going in. I'm excited to see what else they come up with.

12:07 AM. Listening to MIT OpenCourseWare's Lecture 1: Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo).

I'm surprised Github doesn't have a place for developers to leave their notes, either about their progress as a developer or to-do lists related to prjoects. Maybe I just haven't found it yet, but this is also nice.

I wanted to share that I'm scared to contribute to open source. (Github also scared me for the longest time, to shift through files and files of code. I was and still am scared of getting lost.)

Coding and creating digitally is really cool. I'm not the best at it, and my mistakes feel so weighted, but this is something I want to do. I just wanted to share this thought somewhere.
