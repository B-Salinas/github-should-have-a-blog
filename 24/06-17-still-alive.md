I'm still here and still alive. It's been about 6 months since my last entry and ... I thought I would be somewhere else. 

Mentally I am, but physically, I'm still in my hometown, working the same job (upgraded to 5x/week instead of 2x - I do appreciate the routine). My Qube project is further along on paper than it is in it's [repo](https://github.com/B-Salinas/QUBE). The 3-D is delayed and it takes time to see the fruit of your actions, which makes the results all that much sweeter. 

I know I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. I've never stayed at a job this long, I will have been here a whole year come early September.

Had to actually work, so I put my computer away and never came back to this. 

Moral of the story: I thought I would be somewhere else, with different kind of experiences and money, but I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. I've learned the value of hard work and making every penny count. Coming into summer on the 20th, I'm really excited to see what this summer brings. It already feels alot different than previous summers I've had.
