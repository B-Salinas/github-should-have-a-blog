(I'm going to have to go back and format this later.)

Still alive -- my laptop and phone broke. I've upgraded to the iPhone SE (with a home button) and I'm in love. My already cracked 11-in iPad has taken over as the main hub for my things. 

I just figured out how to really utilize Stage Manager yesterday and I'm feeling alright about not having such a machine. 

Everything happens for a reason. It was all to teach me something. I was scared to build, I wasn't taking advantage of the tools I had so they were removed. I have never wanted to build something more so badly. I can still do so, it just doesn't look the way that I expect. The one thing that I really miss is having a second screen. The iPad is strictly for mirroring. It's okay, it works and I'm happy with the setup. 

It's Winter Arc 2024. 
- Apply for jobs that make more than $8.25/hour, preferably in the tech field and remote OR in a city I'd love to live in (ie. Austin, TX)
- Continuing cleaning out my room. A clean space is a clear mind.
- Take long walks again. 
- Read, specifically finish "Read Write Own, Building the Next Era of the Internet" by Chris Dixon.
- Refine QUBE, the journal is complete, but it's all over the place and there are still gaps. 
- Build out QUBE, add SOMETHING to the resume to showcase my work for the past 2 years.
- Meditate, master the mind.
- Leetcode. Approach it as the daily crossworld puzzle. 

Pretty much chop wood, carry the water. The gate is gateless.
